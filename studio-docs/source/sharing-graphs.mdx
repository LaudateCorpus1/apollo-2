Apollo Studio provides features that help you share your graph with both teammates and external consumers.

## Customizing a graph's homepage

When a user opens one of your graph's variants in Apollo Studio, its **homepage** is shown:

Like a typical Git repository's homepage, this page displays a Markdown-based README that you can edit with any content you like.

> **Note:** Only organization members with the [`Org Admin`, `Graph Admin`, or `Contributor` role](./org/members/) can edit a variant's README. If a variant is [protected](./org/graphs/#protected-variants-enterprise-only), `Contributor`s _cannot_ edit its README.

**Each variant has its own README.** If you edit one variant's README, those edits are _not_ applied to your graph's other variants. Among other uses, this enables you to provide different information to external consumers in a [public variant](#making-a-graph-public).

### README shortcodes

The README supports a collection of variables that you can include in its text. These variables are rendered with the correct value for the current variant.



## Public graphs

You can make individual [variants](./org/graphs/#managing-variants) of your graph public. If you do, **anyone with the link** can view the following pages for that variant in Studio:

* Home
* Schema
* Explorer

This enables consumers of your graph to learn about your graph's schema and any special usage information (such as authentication details) that you've documented in [the variant's README](#customizing-a-graphs-homepage). They can also run properly authenticated operations against your graph with the Explorer.

People outside your organization can't view any _other_ pages for a public variant (Fields, Operations, etc.), and they can never view _any_ pages for private variants. New variants always start as private.

### Making a variant public

> **Note:** Only organization members with the [`Org Admin` or `Graph Admin` role](./org/members/) can toggle a variant's visibility.

1. Go to your graph's Settings page and open the Access tab.
2. Under the Variants section, toggle the switch for the variant you want to make public.
3. Confirm your selection.

You can toggle the switch back to make the variant private again.

## Embedding the Explorer

If you have a [public variant](#public-graphs) of your graph, you can embed the [Apollo Studio Explorer](./explorer/) in a webpage that you can then provide to your graph's consumers. This enables those consumers to test out operations from your own website.

For example, here's an embedded Explorer for an Apollo example graph:

<EmbeddableExplorer
  graphRef="Apollo-Fullstack-Demo-o3tsz8@current"
  graphEndpoint="https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/"
  graphSubscriptionEndpoint="wss://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql"
  styles={{width: '100%', height:'450px'}}
/>

> This embedded Explorer collapses its left column by default because the full three-column layout is a little cramped on this page. You can [customize the embedded Explorer's appearance](#options) to suit the page it's on.

### How it works

**The embedded Explorer does not send network requests directly to your GraphQL server!**

Instead, the Explorer's `iframe` uses the `window.postMessage` method to tell your webpage when the user wants to execute a GraphQL operation. _Your webpage_ is then responsible for sending the operation to your GraphQL server (for example, via `fetch`) and then providing the operation result back to the `iframe` via another `postMessage` call.

Because of this, embedding the Explorer requires a little more setup than just adding an `iframe` to your page.

### Examples

* [This repo](https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer-demo-react) demonstrates a React app that embeds the Explorer.

    * See in particular [`setupEmbedRelay.ts`](https://github.com/apollographql/embeddable-explorer-demo-react/blob/main/src/setupEmbedRelay.ts), which contains logic for communicating between the `iframe`, your own page, and your GraphQL server.

* The Explorer embedded [above](#embedding-the-explorer) uses [this component](https://github.com/apollographql/gatsby-theme-apollo/blob/main/packages/gatsby-theme-apollo-docs/src/components/embeddable-explorer.js) from Apollo's Gatsby documentation theme.

### Setup

#### 1. Listen for a request

First, our page needs to listen for messages from our embedded Explorer. Let's add an event listener to our webpage, like so:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts:title=explorer-listener.ts
window.addEventListener('message', onPostMessageReceived);
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

The page begins listening for `message` events, and it calls the `onPostMessageReceived` callback whenever one occurs. Now, we need to define that callback:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts:title=explorer-listener.ts
// This is the message type for relevant messages posted by the iframe
const EXPLORER_QUERY_MUTATION_REQUEST = "ExplorerRequest";

// Callback definition
const onPostMessageReceived = (event:MessageEvent<{
  name?: string,
  operation?: string,
  operationName?: string,
  variables?: string,
  headers?: Record<string, string>
}>) => {

  // Make sure the message's name starts with `ExplorerRequest`
  const isQueryOrMutation = 'name' in event.data && event.data.name?.startsWith(`${EXPLORER_QUERY_MUTATION_REQUEST}:`);

  if (isQueryOrMutation && event.data.name && event.data.operation) {

    // Extract the operation ID from the message name
    const operationId = event.data.name.split(":")[1];
    // Identify the embedded Explorer iframe
    const embeddedExplorerIFrame = document.getElementById("embedded-explorer") as HTMLIFrameElement ?? undefined;
    const { operation, operationName, variables, headers } = event.data;
    // Execute the corresponding GraphQL operation via fetch (shown below)
    executeOperation({
      operation: event.data.operation,
      operationName,
      variables,
      headers,
      embeddedExplorerIFrame,
      operationId,
    });
  }
};
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

As shown above, when a user initiates a query or mutation operation, the Explorer `iframe` posts a message with a name that starts with the string `ExplorerRequest:`. Whenever we receive a message with a matching name, we extract the operation's details from the event and use them to execute the operation.

#### 2. Execute the operation

Our `executeOperation` method looks like this:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts:title=explorer-listener.ts
// This is the message type for response messages expected by the iframe
const EXPLORER_QUERY_MUTATION_RESPONSE = "ExplorerResponse";

// Replace this with your public variant's GraphQL endpoint URL!
const GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = "https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/";

// Replace the value of this URL's `graphRef` query parameter
// with your public variant's graph ref
const EMBEDDABLE_EXPLORER_URL = "https://explorer.embed.apollographql.com/?graphRef=Apollo-Fullstack-Demo-o3tsz8@current";

async function executeOperation({
  operation,
  operationName,
  variables,
  headers,
  embeddedExplorerIFrame,
  operationId,
}: {
  operation: string,
  operationName?: string,
  variables?: JSONValue,
  headers?: Record<string, string>,
  embeddedExplorerIFrame?: HTMLIFrameElement,
  operationId: string
}) {
  // Send the operation to the GraphQL server via fetch
  const response = await fetch(
    GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: getHeadersWithContentType(headers),
      // Include the operation string, variables, and operation
      // name in the request body
      body: JSON.stringify({
        query: operation,
        variables,
        operationName,
      }),
    }
  );
  // After the operation completes, post a message back to
  // the Explorer's iframe
  await response.json().then((response) => {
    embeddedExplorerIFrame?.contentWindow?.postMessage(
      {
        name: `${EXPLORER_QUERY_MUTATION_RESPONSE}:${operationId}`,
        response,
      },
      EMBEDDABLE_EXPLORER_URL
    );
  });
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

The `executeOperation` method takes all of the parameters it needs to execute the GraphQL operation and post its result back to the `iframe`.

As shown, the `iframe` expects a `message` event with the name format `ExplorerResponse:OPERATION_ID`, where `OPERATION_ID` is the same value provided by the `iframe` in its `ExplorerRequest` message.

#### Add the `iframe`

All that remains is to add the Explorer `iframe` to our web content:


### Options

When you embed the Explorer, you set options for it by including query parameters in the `src` URL of the `iframe`, like so:

```jsx:title=EmbeddedExplorer.jsx
return (
  <iframe src={`https://explorer.embed.apollographql.com/?graphRef=${myGraphRef}&docsPanelState=closed`} />
);
```

The following options are supported:

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `graphRef`

`string`

</td>
<td>

**Recommended.** The graph ref for the [public variant](#public-graphs) you want to use the embedded Explorer with. Has the format `graph-name@variant-name`.

The Explorer fetches this variant's schema from Apollo Studio to populate its Documentation panel and enable symbol completion.

If you omit this option, the Explorer still loads, but it is much less helpful to your graph's consumers.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `docsPanelState`

`"open" | "closed"`

</td>
<td>

If `open`, the Explorer's Documentation panel (the left column) is initially expanded. If `closed`, the panel is initially collapsed.

The default value is `open`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `showHeadersAndEnvVars`

`"true" | "false"`

</td>
<td>

If `true`, the embedded Explorer includes the panels for [setting request headers and environment variables](./explorer/#authentication). If `false`, those panels are not present.

The default value is `true`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `theme`

`"dark" | "light"`

</td>
<td>

If `dark`, the Explorer's dark theme is used. If `light`, the light theme is used.

The default value is `dark`.

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Message types

Your webpage and the embedded Explorer use the `postMessage` API to send messages to each other. Every message posted this way has an `event.data.name` with the following format:

```
MESSAGE_TYPE:OPERATION_ID
```

* `MESSAGE_TYPE` indicates the type of message being sent (e.g., `ExplorerRequest`).
* `OPERATION_ID` is a unique generated ID for a particular operation that the user initiates in the embedded Explorer.
    * You include this same operation ID in the names of messages you post from your page so the Explorer knows which operation the message pertains to.

These are all of the message types used by the embedded Explorer's `iframe` and your page:

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

##### `ExplorerRequest`

</td>
<td>

Posted by the `iframe` to notify your page that the user wants to execute a query or mutation.

The following operation details are included in the associated `event.data` object:

* `operation` (string)
* `operationName` (string)
* `variables` (object)
* `headers` (object)

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `ExplorerResponse`

</td>
<td>

Posted by your page to notify the `iframe` of a query or mutation result. The message should be the operation's JSON response object.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `ExplorerSubscriptionRequest`

</td>
<td>

Posted by the `iframe` to notify your page that the user wants to execute a subscription operation.

The same operation details are included in the `event.data` object that are included in [`ExplorerRequest` messages](#explorerrequest).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `ExplorerSubscriptionResponse`

</td>
<td>

Posted by your page to notify the `iframe` of a new subscription result. The message should be the subscription's new JSON response object.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `ExplorerSubscriptionTermination`

</td>
<td>

Posted by the `iframe` to notify your page that the user wants to terminate an active subscription operation.

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
