**Apollo Sandbox** is a special instance of the [Explorer](./explorer/) that doesn't require an Apollo account. Sandbox doesn't support advanced Explorer features like schema history, but it's great for local development.

<p>
  <Button
    size="large"
    color={colors.primary}
    as={<Link to="https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/" target="_blank" />}
  >
    Launch Sandbox
  </Button>
</p>

Sandbox automatically attempts to connect to a GraphQL server running at `http://localhost:4000`. You can use the box at the top of the page to change this URL to any local or remote GraphQL endpoint that's accessible by your browser:

>To try out Sandbox with an example GraphQL API, you can set its URL to `https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index`.

### Offline Sandbox

You can use Sandbox _without_ an internet connection if you're querying a graph running on `localhost`. To do so, [open Sandbox in your browser](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/) at least once while connected to the internet. You can then use that browser to open Sandbox while offline.

#### Reconnecting

Sandbox automatically reconnects to Apollo Studio whenever your internet connection is restored. When it does, it might display a notification that your Apollo Studio application version is stale by at least 24 hours. You can click the notification to update _all_ of your browser's open Apollo Studio tabs to the latest version.

> This notification indicates only that the Apollo Studio _UI_ is out of date. Your Studio _data_ is always kept up to date.
