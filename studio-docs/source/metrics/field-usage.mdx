title: Measuring field usage in Apollo Studio
sidebar_title: Field usage
description: Understand which fields your clients use
---

In Apollo Studio, your graph's **Fields** page can display usage metrics for each field in your schema. For example, here are metrics for the fields of a `BuildError` type:

<img src="../img/fields-page.jpg" class="screenshot" alt="Fields page in Studio" width="700" />

You can click any field in the table to view details about which clients and operations contribute to its usage.

The table displays some combination of the following metrics for each field, depending on what data is available:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Field executions** in the last day | How many times your servers have executed the resolver for the field, according to [trace data](/metrics/usage-reporting/) provided by your servers. |
| **Referencing operations** in the last day | How many operations sent by clients have included the field, according to metrics provided by your servers. |

For each of these columns to appear on the Fields page, your GraphQL servers must report the associated metrics to Apollo Studio. If some but not _all_ of your GraphQL servers report this data, the Fields page presents an incomplete picture of your graph's field usage.


## Field executions vs. referencing operations

Let's look at the example metrics for the `BuildError` type again:

<img src="../img/fields-page.jpg" class="screenshot" alt="Fields page in Studio" width="700" />

As you can see, the daily **field executions** and **referencing operations** for a single field can differ significantly! There are many possible reasons for this, described below.

### Objects in lists

Let's say a client executes the following query one time:

```graphql
query GetBooks {
  books {
    title
  }
}
```

If `Query.books` returns a list of ten `Book` objects, then `Book.title` is resolved _ten times_. This query therefore contributes _ten_ **field executions** and just _one_ **referencing operation** to `Book.title`.

### Fields that return interfaces

Let's say our GraphQL server's schema defines the following interface and object types:

```graphql
interface Media {
  title: String!
}

type Book implements Media {
  title: String!
  author: String!
}

type Query {
  favoriteMedia: Media!
}
```

Now, let's say a client executes the following query:

```graphql
query GetFavoriteMedia {
  favoriteMedia {
    title
  }
}
```

If `Query.favoriteMedia` returns a `Book` object here, then `Book.title` is resolved one time. _However_, the original query _does not reference_ `Book.title`. Instead, it references **`Media.title`**.

Therefore, this query contributes _one_ **field execution** and _zero_ **referencing operations** to `Book.title`.

### Referenced fields that aren't resolved

Let's say a client executes the following query one time:

```graphql
query GetLoggedInUser {
  loggedInUser {
    name
  }
}
```

Now, let's say `Query.loggedInUser` returns `null` because no user is logged in. In this case, the resolver for `User.name` never executes, because its parent retuns `null`. Therefore, this query contributes _zero_ **field executions** and _one_ **referencing operation** to `User.name`.

A referenced field might also not be resolved for any of these reasons:

* The resolver is skipped due to a `@skip` or `@include` directive.
* The field is part of a fragment that doesn't apply to a particular object.
* The field's resolver is called for each item in a list, but the list is empty.
